  abstract = {Studies the dependence on time delay tau of the average echo power I( tau ) resulting from the reflection of a quasi-monochromatic outgoing pulse of radiation by a multiscale random surface, modelled as a fractal with Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension D+1 between 2 and 3. In the 'weak fractal' limit where the fractal height variations are small, the reflection is paraxial and I( tau ) decays as tau -(3-D) , for both statistically isotropic and 'corrugated' surfaces. This behaviour contrasts with a smooth random surface, for which I( tau ) decays exponentially.},

  title        = {Modeling and Measurement of Spatial Coherence for Normal Incidence Seafloor Scattering},
  comment      = {<The spatial coherence analysis is a bit like estimating the spectrum of a windowed random process. Dan's assumptions state that the random process has a flat, bandlimited,  spectrum and a delta function spatial autocovariance. More general models should include the autocovariance of the scattered field at the interface. Perturbation theory dictates that the field at a the surface is equal to
\[
p_s(x,y) = - f(x,y) \frac{\partial p_0}{\partial z}
\]

Therefore the auto covariance of the field is related to the autocovariance of the random rough surface. If the surface has a huge correlation length, then p_s will be correlated over large spatial separations. HOweer, the rms roughnesss is usually bigger as you increase the ensonified area, so first-order perturbation theory is unlikely to be a good approximation. Second order perturbation theory is
\[
p^{(1)}_s(x,y) = f^2(x,y) \frac{\partial p^1(x,y)}{\partial z}
\]

To form a consistent covariance, we need to use the second moment,
\[
\left \langle p p\ast \right \rangle = %
	\left \langle p_{1} p_{1}^\ast + p_{2} p_2^\ast + p_1 p_3^\ast + p_1^\ast p_3 \right \rangle
\]

My guess is that the second-order terms (inensity to order (kh)^4) will decrease the correlation length. The 13 terms often cancel out much of the 22 terms.},

They retain the second-order term from liszka_mccoy and determine that for very rough interfaces, the second order term comprises about 1/2 the intensity of the total field (3 dB) and is responsible for enhanced backscattering. They do not formally average the second-order term, which I would like to see. perhaps this term can mitigate overestimation of the field near grazing angle by the first-order term, and perhaps help explain Lambertian scattering. Statistical self-shadowing could be included too.},

spatially nonstationarity is modelled using a locally smooth correlation funtion that itself is spatially varying. THis assumes an underlying continuous process. Due to the imaging point spread function, a SAS / SAR image is continous, but there are large spikes, or changes in intensity that make this modl inadequate.

Need to describe in detail, and maybe find a data example where this is the case. or not the case. Gravel might be modeled using a NonGaussian, stationary random process. HOwever, a collection of stones on sand, or worms on sand is not a stationary process. The distribution of worms can be describe,d but causes large intensity jumps, or discrete patches of high intensity. These  fluctuations in intensity is what makes up the texture of a worm patch. These fluctuations cannot be modeled using a stationary random process. Better to model it using a discrete process that has a realization as a continouus process in an image.},

The interpretation of their acoustic facies may not always be straightforward. - this is good for me. I can offer some interpretation. Heinrich may do more interpretation.

The ability to discriminate the patchy texture is highly dependent on the system specifications (i.e. frequency and beam widths), the survey specifica- tions (parallel versus longitudinal track lines, gain settings and altitude above the bottom), but above all weather conditions (e.g. wave action). The first two technical aspects can easily be dealt with adequately, based on the current knowledge of L. conchilega reef features (e.g. surface area and elevation). However, bad weather conditions cannot be controlled and may drastically deteriorate the image quality.

This lower level of development was illustrated by the relatively low elevation levels of the L. conchilega reefs (maximum: 11.5 cm), measured during our intertidal survey in late winter (February). However, during the side- scan sonar survey in the intertidal zone we were able to detect even these less developed reefs, indicating the high sensitivity of very-high resolution side-scan sonar to L. conchilega reefs

Lower-resolution side-scan sonar proved less efficient in the detection of the reefs, mainly because of its larger beam width. Although the low resolution data still weakly detected the L. conchilega reefs, one should be aware that the altitude of the sonar fish above the seafloor was only 1 m. In the subtidal area, where the fish was on average 3 to 4 m above the seafloor, the footprint was much larger and it became unlikely to observe these less developed reefs with low resolution data. Yet, if – for example as a consequence of recruitment failure – reefs further erode below a critical size and elevation, they will eventually become undetectable even with very-high resolution side-scan sonar.},

The discussion includes expansions of the type originally used by E. T. Whittaker involving only homogeneous plane waves, and of the type introduced by H. Weyl involving both homogeneous and inhomogeneous plane waves. Expressions for the plane-wave amplitudes for both types of representations are obtained in terms of the source function, and precise conditions under which each expansion is valid are given. It is shown that when both types of expansions are valid, the superposition of inhomogeneous plane waves in the Weyl-type representation is equal to the superposition of the homogeneous plane waves that propagate into a specific half-space in the Whittaker-type representation. It is shown also that in restricted space-time regions only a certain subset of the plane waves in the Whittaker-type expansion contribute to the field. This result leads to a simple expression for the field valid at large distances from the source.},

It's good to know that other data analysis procedures are just as fudgey as mine. Lots of nice data analysis details. lessons learned: propagation in air is very temporally and spatially varying and hard to know mean propagation conditions.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) is a signal process-
ing technique which increases the along-track resolution in sonar
images by coherent combination of collected pings. Successful
SAS processing is dependent on accurate navigation, knowledge
about the ocean environment, and accurate bathymetric maps.
In general, the quality of SAS images will vary dependent on
these factors. We propose a model for automated prediction and
assessment of SAS performance or image quality. The intended
use is to give an estimate of the local quality of data in a particular
SAS image. The model consists of modules for generalized signal
to noise, geometric resolution, radiometric resolution (value
accuracy) and image sharpness. In this paper, specifically focus
on image sharpness. We show example data sets collected by an
interferometric SAS on an autonomous underwater vehicle.},

  abstract     = {In this work model-based methods are employed along with machine learning techniques to classify sediments in oceanic environments based on the geoacoustic properties of a two-layer seabed. Two different scenarios are investigated. First, a simple low-frequency case is set up, where the acoustic field is modeled with normal modes. Four different hypotheses are made for seafloor sediment possibilities and these are explored using both various machine learning techniques and a simple matched-field approach. For most noise levels, the latter has an inferior performance to the machine learning methods. Second, the high-frequency model of the scattering from a rough, two-layer seafloor is considered. Again, four different sediment possibilities are classified with machine learning. For higher accuracy, 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed. In both cases we see that the machine learning methods, both in simple and more complex formulations, lead to effective sediment characterization. Our results assess the robustness to noise and model misspecification of different classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Seafloor characteristics like roughness and clutter density affect the complexity
in sonar images, significantly influencing the achievable performance for detection and
classification of bottom targets, e.g. mines. The introduction of autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUV) into mine countermeasures (MCM) operations has thus created a need to
measure such properties in imagery from high-resolution side-looking sonar (real or
synthetic aperture) using a consistent metric. In this paper, we present our approach for
quantifying the complexity in sonar images with a continuous, multi-scale measure based
on local variances of wavelet coefficients obtained by the two-dimensional maximal
overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). Moreover, we determine the presence of
anisotropy, i.e. image textures with a clear directionality like sand ripples, through a
combination of ratios from wavelet variances and rotated integral images. The proposed
method is applied to synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images, where promising results are
achieved both in terms of validity and computational time. We see image complexity as an
essential parameter for MCM performance estimation. Further it can also be used to
improve the performance of automatic target recognition (ATR) by adapting the processing
to the given environment.},

  comment      = {This method requires point scatterers. The point spread function can be easily estimated from that.

It has been suggested that the speckle could be used to estimate the psf as well, by forming the autocovariance function of the specke. However, there are issues with bias sample autocovariance. What if an ARMA model is used on the speckel to directly estimate its parameters. Using the forward-backward method, it is unbiased. the Forward backwards method is based on a linear predictor, so it does not require windowing. I have matlab code to do this. Then the autocovariance could be estimated from the ARMA coefficients. An ideal covariance could be computed by assuming that the seafloor response is white noise, and the along-track and down-range processes are filtered versions of that white noise. FOr example, a Gaussian model could be fit to the theoretical covariance. Then we find the ratio of the width (defined in some sense - using the integral of the ACF, or 3dB down points), of the theoretical ACF and the measured ACF. That ratio could be a measure of sharpness.

Need to talk to Marc and find out what problems they have been running into with using the speckle to estimate sharpness.},

  abstract      = {Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) requires precise positional and environmental information to produce well-focused output during the image reconstruction step. However, errors in these measurements are commonly present resulting in defocused imagery. To overcome these issues, an \emph{autofocus} algorithm is employed as a post-processing step after image reconstruction for the purpose of improving image quality using the image content itself. These algorithms are usually iterative and metric-based in that they seek to optimize an image sharpness metric. In this letter, we demonstrate the potential of machine learning, specifically deep learning, to address the autofocus problem. We formulate the problem as a self-supervised, phase error estimation task using a deep network we call Deep Autofocus. Our formulation has the advantages of being non-iterative (and thus fast) and not requiring ground truth focused-defocused images pairs as often required by other deblurring deep learning methods. We compare our technique against a set of common sharpness metrics optimized using gradient descent over a real-world dataset. Our results demonstrate Deep Autofocus can produce imagery that is perceptually as good as benchmark iterative techniques but at a substantially lower computational cost. We conclude that our proposed Deep Autofocus can provide a more favorable cost-quality trade-off than state-of-the-art alternatives with significant potential of future research.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine whether or not information theory can be one of the theoretic frameworks for visualization. We
formulate concepts and measurements for qualifying visual information. We illustrate these concepts with examples that manifest the
intrinsic and implicit use of information theory in many existing visualization techniques. We outline the broad correlation between
visualization and the major applications of information theory, while pointing out the difference in emphasis and some technical
gaps. Our study provides compelling evidence that information theory can explain a significant number of phenomena or events in
visualization, while no example has been found which is fundamentally in conflict with information theory. We also notice that the
emphasis of some traditional applications of information theory, such as data compression or data communication, may not always
suit visualization, as the former typically focuses on the efficient throughput of a communication channel, whilst the latter focuses
on the effectiveness in aiding the perceptual and cognitive process for data understanding and knowledge discovery. These findings
suggest that further theoretic developments are necessary for adopting and adapting information theory for visualization.},

  comments     = {Culmination of their earlier article on enhanced backscattering. This time they present an ensembl-averaged version of the second-order kirchhoff approximation together with incident shadowing and second-order (propagation) shadowing. They conclude that as rms height increases, the backscattering peak increases too and is accounted for by the second-order term. Gaussian spectra and statitistics are used. May be I could apply these results for von Karman surface, or perhaps a facet surface. The second-order integratoins are simplified using asumptotic evalutions. These simplified forms have some interesting physical interpretations. The second-order integration yields a "ladder" term, which accounts for specular peaks, and a cross term, which accounts for backscattering enhancement. I need to go over this in detail and perhaps implement it for a power-law case.},

The authors conclude that there is essentially no difference up to 5th order between the two theories, and the substantially easier derivation using the Rayleigh hypothesis should be used.

The feature values are localized in wavenumber space too. These correspond to the spectral properties of the image. Jain and Farrohkinia technique is good for segmenting different types of isotropic and anisotropic spectra. HOwever, it still assumes a locally stationary random process, since it does its feature detection in wavenumber domain. The type of nonstationarity I am considering is not very distinguishable form a stationary process in the wavenumber domain. The spatial domain is where the patchiness lives. Patches could have different scattering strength, but same texture. Patches could have different scattering strength, and different texture.

Patch is like the second smallest contextual unit I am considering.},

% A review of the considerations involved in implementing high-performance
% FFTs in practice, explaining why issues such as memory access dictate
% a different design from textbook radix-2 FFTs; some overlap with FFTW05.

A lot of approximate and asymptotic forms of integrals are performed to illuminate the role of each terms. Integration is divied into near, and far-fields. The far-field integration is divided into multiple reflections and shadowed terms. Chen and Ishimaru (1990) study the first two terms numerically. I feel like I can apply this to my research and use an iterative technique to solve the linear algebra problem.},

Since this is a not directly measurable quantity, it is of little importance. From that fact, the results of this paper follow trivially starting from the definition of the scattering coefficient (m = sigma = cross section). Here, $\Delta m_p / m_p$ is a small quantity if and only if the receiver is in the far field of t he scattering patch. Stated in words, this means that the relative variation in the scattering coefficient must be small for the angular width of the ensonified path (which is a finite, and not infinitesimal quantity). Lots of interesting stuff here. Winebrenner and Ishimaru have a paper about this, as does Jackson (in his appendix J).},

  abstract     = {Seafloor backscatter mosaics are now routinely produced from multibeam echosounder data and used in a wide range of marine applications. However, large differences (>5 dB) can often be observed between the mosaics produced by different software packages processing the same dataset. Without transparency of the processing pipeline and the lack of consistency between software packages raises concerns about the validity of the final results. To recognize the source(s) of inconsistency between software, it is necessary to understand at which stage(s) of the data processing chain the differences become substantial. To this end, willing commercial and academic software developers were invited to generate intermediate processed backscatter results from a common dataset, for cross-comparison. The first phase of the study requested intermediate processed results consisting of two stages of the processing sequence: the one-value-per-beam level obtained after reading the raw data and the level obtained after radiometric corrections but before compensation of the angular dependence. Both of these intermediate results showed large differences between software solutions. This study explores the possible reasons for these differences and highlights the need for collaborative efforts between software developers and their users to improve the consistency and transparency of the backscatter data processing sequence.},

Two power series oare used, one fo r the large scale and another for the small scale. Ends up wtih the rsult <sigma> = <n*k> W(Delta K). W is not aeraged because it ias assumed to be with respect to the large-scale slopes. For a von Karman surafces thi is not the case..., but at small grazing angles, the bragg angle is roughly constant. The Kirchhoff approximation at small scales also gives the same answer (why???). Electromagnetic scattering measurements match with the composite roughness approximations. Acousitc experiemtns match at low waveheights. Bounds for the approximation used in the derivation are found. She ignores shadowin g and multiple scatteringwhaich I think is spurious. BUt the Kirchhoff approximation isn't generally used at low grazing angles. The Curvature corretion tot he Kirchhoff approximation could be significant for me. Compare these results to the rsult for Jansson's perturbation theory on a sphere / cylinder.},

The method ends up settling into an accepted kind of analogy because of the way the optimization algorithm was set up. I need to work thorugh the parts of the model again. However, I think the slipnet prioritizes structural richness, and that "cost function" leads us to the what we think should be the right analogy. So we prioritize.

The cloud's scattering amplitude is an average over particle orientation (derived from conservation of angular momentum), particle size, shape, and number density distribution. A uniform #particles/volume is assumed. Main results is: $\sigma = \langle \Phi^2\rangle = \left(\frac{k_0^2 V}{4 \pi}\right) \lbrace \left( \frac{e-1}{e} + \frac{3(h-1)}{2h+1}\right)^2\rbrace. Methodology: ensemble averaging, solution to spherical scattering similar to pierce and blackstock.},

An essential aspect of texture analysis is the extraction of features that describe the distribution of values in local spatial regions. The proposed histogram layer leverages the spatial distribution of features for texture analysis and parameters for the layer are estimated during backpropagation. We compare our method with state-of-the-art texture encoding methods such as the Deep Encoding Network (DEP) and Deep Texture Encoding Network (DeepTEN) on three texture datasets: (1) the Describable Texture Dataset (DTD); (2) an extension of the ground terrain in outdoor scenes (GTOS-mobile); (3) and a subset of the Materials in Context (MINC-2500) dataset. Results indicate that the inclusion of the proposed histogram layer improves performance. The source code for the histogram layer is publicly available.},

Here, we present a method to identify predictive texture patterns in medical images in an unsupervised way. Based on deep clustering networks, we simultaneously encode and cluster medical image patches in a low-dimensional latent space. The resulting clusters serve as features for disease staging, linking them to the underlying disease. We evaluate the method on 70 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of patients with different stages of liver steatosis. The deep clustering approach is able to find predictive clusters with a stable ranking, differentiating between low and high steatosis with an F1-Score of 0.78.},

The development is stilted, mathematical and boring. I don't like reading these diffraction papers. It's much easier to deal with calculations of means and second moments. Pierce is very pedantic. The concept of a diffraction boundary layer is introduced and the diffracted field is found to be a simple function of the free-space greens function, a phase factor and the auxiliary Fresnel functions (19). Double diffraction is examined (see Biot and Tolstoy, and Tolstoy). Intuitive formulae for doubly diffracted terms are given by (24). He regrets departure from mathematical rigor, but couldn't help himself.},

  abstract     = {We present a new algorithm for discovering patterns in time series and other sequential data. We exhibit a reliable procedure for building the minimal set of hidden, Markovian states that is statistically capable of producing the behavior exhibited in the data -- the underlying process's causal states. Unlike conventional methods for fitting hidden Markov models (HMMs) to data, our algorithm makes no assumptions about the process's causal architecture (the number of hidden states and their transition structure), but rather infers it from the data. It starts with assumptions of minimal structure and introduces complexity only when the data demand it. Moreover, the causal states it infers have important predictive optimality properties that conventional HMM states lack. We introduce the algorithm, review the theory behind it, prove its asymptotic reliability, use large deviation theory to estimate its rate of convergence, and compare it to other algorithms which also construct HMMs from data. We also illustrate its behavior on an example process, and report selected numerical results from an implementation.},

  comments     = {Subcritical penetration into a panama city test pond sediment has been reported by Nick Chotiros. He attributes this phenomenon to the existence of a slow-compressional wave in the sediment predicted by Biot's theory of poroelasticity. This effect is examined in the context of a fluid-fluid rough boundary. Scattering by roughnesss is seen to be responsible for the slow wave. The angle-range ambiguity plots (??) are explained by the face that the scattered field propagates with a certain wavefront that isn't necessarily the same as the scattered wavefront. Two methods are used: 1) formally averaged perturbation theroy and 2) montecarlo perturbation theory. Both methods predict subcritical penetration and the slowness well.},

An infinite series with coefficients found recursively is presented. if O>2 is neglected, then double diffraction term can capture most observed behavior. Lots of complex series solutions are proposed. Not sure how I can simplify them. Might be able to apply these formulae to a fractured rock face. If Iknow the joint pdf of areas and orientations, then maybe only retaining direct terms (diffracted terms might be orders of magnitude less, but might play a role). methodology: assuming rigid boundary conditions, procedure similar to that found in pierce},

  comments     = {Statistical shelf-shadowing of a rough surface with gaussian statistics and gaussian correlation are examined. The us of this shadowing function is slightly suspect. It is based on heuristic arguments with single-scattering assumed. A summary of results are presented in Jackson's composite roughness paper. Interesting things to note: diffraction is not included. Shaodowin not only reduces the illuminated area by also skews the slope and height distributions positively and the surface will act as if tilted away. This result is ONLY applicable to the high-frequency kirchhoff approximation. The perturbation approximation does not use the same formalism and is a resonant effect. So long as the horizontal wavenumber is roughly constant over the incident field, the patchwork illumination caused by statistical self-shadowing probably does not affect the physical scattering mechanisms because of the resonant effect. The total incident energy will be the same on the mean field, but just distributed differently across the rough field. I don't think shadowing is important for the perturbation theory result, but may improve the accuracy of the Kirchhoff approximation.},

At large separations, there is a large aperture, but smaller SNR. There is a sweet spot of about 10 lambda that maximizes the Fisher information.},

  comments     = {Perturbation theory applied to Neumann, Dirichlet rough surfaces, and impedance and admittance varying flat surfaces. The Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions contain problems. In the limit of grazing incidence and scattering angles for Neumann boundary conditions, the scattering cross section fails to satisfy unitarity conditions (i.e. does not conserve energy). In the limit that the angular frequency goes to zero for Dirichlet boundary conditions, the scattering cross-section contains a singularity. Watson and Keller resolve these problem by ``renormalization''. This procedure is detailed in Twersky (ref 1-twersky_1957)) and uses an alternate form for C (similar to Aww in Jackson) C = (1 + Q)/(1-Q). The function, Q, is matched to C by equating their power series in the smallness parameter up to second order. They claim that this ``renormalization'' includes multiple scattering effects up to second order. No physical justification or explanation is given. I should like to see more of that. Renormalization here is much different than the procedure used in Orris and Dashen.},

  comments     = {A different perturbative technique. See his "investigation" paper or thesis for a detailed derivation. This technique differs from the classical perturbation technique. In the classical "field" pert. tech, the correction factor, f(r|k), is expanded in a power series. In this one, the function phi = log (f) is expanded in a perturbation series. My intuition is that low-orders of the phase perturbation series include higher-orders of the field (or corrections). THis technique is used to extend the domain of validity for perturbative methods. See Jackson's paper about the comparison of perturbation theories. In the appendix, special cases of the phase perturbation cross section are seen to reduce to both the classical perturbation cross-section and the Kirchhoff approximation. Figure out why this is the case!},

  comments     = {Derive the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral equation for scattering from a rough infinite surface with Neumann boundary conditions. Only general cases are considered (using the correlation function as an input). The integral is reduced by using translational invariance (which allows pulling out of a delta function in k-space. General formulae for the second moment of the scattered field are presented analagous to Jackson' s C = <TT*>, along with the delta function business. These delta functions come from the translational invariance of the second moment of the scattered field. Maybe I can make sense of them now... These second moment equations constitute the Behte-Salpeter equations (the first moment is Dyson's equation). These can be solved iteratively (in the kirchhoff sense??) and their diagram interpretations are written out. These consist of propagator terms, and interaction terms (with an integral A defined the same way as in J + R). Evaluation: overall this paper is very useful to see the construction of the integral equation (well not so much), simplifications that can be used due to translational invariance and variational techniques. Construction of second moment formulae and how everything together makes some sense now. No plots or explicit calculations are performed on the integral equations.},
