  Abstract                 = {A large variety of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are currently under development or in production. In order for an AUV to be useful, its self-navigation capabilities must support the mission requirements. Often, underwater acoustic navigation techniques must be utilized in order to meet the navigational accuracy requirements. In addition to vehicle self-navigation, most AUV operators also require a method of tracking the vehicle while it is underway, so that its progress may be monitored, and also so that it may be located easily upon surfacing, or in the event of a vehicle failure. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has developed a buoy-based system that simultaneously provides for both vehicle self-navigation and external tracking. This system has been used extensively by WHOI to support the REMUS AUV operations, and has also been used by the Naval Oceanographic Office to support sea-trials of the LAZARUS vehicle system. Long Baseline Acoustic Navigation is often the preferred subsea navigation method. It is generally accomplished by deploying two or more acoustic transponders, moored to the seafloor, near the desired area of operations. The vehicle then interrogates the transponders, determines its range to each, and finds its position using triangulation techniques. WHOI has developed a radio-controlled buoy, which can serve as a navigation transponder for the vehicle, and can also be commanded via the radio link to interrogate the AUV and report the measured travel time back to the operator. This paper describes the PARADIGM (Portable Acoustic RADio Geo-referenced Monitoring) system architecture, and presents data describing results achieved},

  Abstract                 = {In 2000, a major expedition for deepwater archaeology was conducted by the Institute for Exploration in the Black Sea along the northwestern coast of Turkey from the Bosporus to the Turkish seaport of Sinop. A complementary land-based expedition will be reported upon elsewhere. The 2000 underwater expedition had three research objectives: to search for evidence of human habitation prior to major flooding of the Black Sea that researchers predicted occurred some 7,500 years ago; to investigate a deepwater shipping route; and to search for ancient wooden ships in the sea's anoxic bottom waters. Research methods included the use of a phased-array side-scan sonar, a towed imaging sled, and a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to collect deep-sea survey data. Three shipwrecks and a probable site reflecting human habitation prior to the proposed flooding event were located at depths around 100 m. One additional shipwreck was found within the anoxic layer at a depth of 324 m. The ship found within the anoxic layer was intact, in a high state of preservation, and dated to the Byzantine period of 450 A.D.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1997, two shipwrecks were first discovered in the Mediterranean Sea west of Israel by the U.S. Navy's research Submarine NR-1. Further investigation in 1999 with the remotely operated vehicle system Medea/Jason found the wrecks to be from the eighth century B.C., the earliest known shipwrecks to be found in the deep sea. Both ships appear to be of Phoenician origin, laden with cargoes of fine wine destined for either Egypt or Carthage, when they were lost in a storm on the high seas. The ships lie upright on the seafloor at a depth of 400 m in a depression formed by the scour of bottom currents. Their discovery suggests that ancient mariners took direct routes to their destinations even if it meant traveling beyond sight of land.},

" Choices in any part of the system architecture (e.g., sensor characteristics) have major impacts upon other parts of the system. In general it is very dangerous to think that any one component (such as intelligence) can be isolated and studied by itself." - Uncertainty in the data association problem (and data fusion) is greatly reduced if we through out the idea of objective world model representations and design behaviors that operate directly on the sensor data. The creature does not need to maintain an estimate of uncertainty. - Instead of having an objective world model, he advocates using a sensor based model. Uses anecdotes of understanding an environment directly through the particularities of the sensor. Our application is a bit different in that the primary task is to deliver an objective map of the environment!!! - Advocates a sensor-based representation (vs. a target-based representation) - see Bar-Shalom's MHT for a similar debate in a much different context. - Animal Ethology - the study of animal behaviors from a functional and causal viewpoint. - Key Research Area: we do not have any analytic tools for understanding in advance what sort of conflicts and other unexpected interactions might arise from the ways we paste together behaviors using these methodologies.},

These instruments are designed to precisely measure horizontal deformation across the axis of a mid-ocean ridge in order to detect and quantify seafloor spreading events. The instruments were deployed in semipermanent seafloor benchmarks in a linear array that is 1.2-km long and spans the floor of the axial valley. The instruments make daily measurements of distance to their neighbors in the array by recording the round trip travel time of 100-kHz acoustic pulses, and simultaneous temperature measurements are used to correct the ranges for sound speed variations. The instruments are expected to have lifetimes of at least five years. In addition, precise pressure measurements have been made at each benchmark with a remotely operated vehicle in order to monitor for vertical deformation across the array. Preliminary results show that the resolution of the acoustic measurements is ±1-2 cm and that no abrupt deformation events occurred during the first year},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind in the lowest 8 metres over a reservoir (1·6 km × 1 km) has been measured using sensitive anemometers freely exposed from a fixed mast in water 16 m deep, the fetch being more than 1 km. The resulting profiles are closely logarithmic, the small differences being systematic and possibly due to the thermal instability which existed when the measurements were made. The usual law for wind profiles in neutral stability is \documentclass{article}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}\$\$ \frac{u}{{u\_* }}\; = \;\frac{1}{k}\;\log \;\frac{z}{{z(0)}} \$\$\end{document} where u is the wind speed at height z, k is von Kármán's constant, log z (0) the intercept on the log z axis, and u* the so-called friction velocity defined by τ0 = pu, τ0 being the surface drag and rH the density of the air. To characterize the profiles u*/k, their slope, was plotted in relation to z (0), their intercept; this allowed a direct comparison with other profiles, in particular those recently measured in a laboratory channel by Sibul. The agreement was better than expected and indicated that z (0) was comparatively independent of fetch and stability but was largely determined by u*. The relation between u* and z (0) agreed roughly with the simplest non-dimensional relation between them, gz (0)/u = constant, so that one is led to a generalized wind profile for flow over a water surface \documentclass{article}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}\$\$ \frac{u}{{u\_* }}\; = \;\frac{1}{k}\;\log \;\frac{{gz}}{{u\_* ^2 }}\; + \;{\rm constant} \$\$\end{document} which specifies the drag, given the wind at one known height. An approximate value of the constant is 12·5. This expression can be compared with earlier work. The better wind-profile observations show rough agreement; the experimental scatter is necessarily large since a water surface is aerodynamically much smoother than most land surfaces, precision anemometry in difficult circumstances being required to provide sufficiently precise values. Oceanographic measurements of the tilt of water surfaces are in fair agreement at high wind speeds but at low wind speeds the data are conflicting. The early results which imply that the drag-coefficient (u/u2) increases with decreasing wind speed in light winds are thought to be in error; some support for this belief comes from recent estimates of drag using a modified ageostrophic technique, which agree roughly among themselves and with the general expression.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2001, C & C Technologies, Inc. of Lafayette, Louisiana began using the HUGIN 3000 AUV in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore oil and gas surveys. This new survey vehicle is faster, more accurate, and more maneuverable than conventional deep-tow systems and has raised the bar for deepwater geophysical and hydrographic surveys. Although archaeology was not the primary purpose for developing the vehicle, archaeologists are and will continue to benefit from its use. Archaeological investigation with a conventional deep-tow system is seldom conducted during industry surveys because of the cost and time involved in operating such a system. However, during the first year of operation with the HUGIN 3000, four shipwrecks were investigated as a result of the HUGIN’s cost effectiveness. The use of the HUGIN 3000 directly led to the discovery of the long sought after German submarine, U-166, which was located near its last victim, the passenger freighter SS Robert E. Lee. This AUV also helped document two additional newly discovered shipwrecks: The cargo freighter SS Alcoa Puritan and a small wooden sailing vessel known as the Mica wreck.},

  abstract = {Underwater vehicles operating near of the sea surface are subject to wave disturbances in their motion, severely affecting the quality of bathymetric maps obtained. This paper describes a controller structure for compensating the wave disturbances in the vertical plane for a torpedo-like Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), based on a modified version of the LQG/LTR controller methodology with a wave filter. The proposed methodology uses additionally to the classic LQG/LTR design the measurement of non-controlled states, such as the pitch rate and heave velocity, in the control action. The wave disturbances were filtered away by a shaping filter fitted to the sea spectrum, and the sensors signals were integrated by a extended Kalman filter. The proposed control methodology was tested against the classical LQG/LTR controller in a six degrees of freedom non-linear AUV simulator, producing a better performance in most demanding conditions, like high wave crests.},

  annote = {- goes through some basics of hyperbolic/spherical/time sync positioning. works out a simple optimal path problem. unsurprisingly the optimal path is to go into the center - uses simulated annealing :( - arrival matching. works through a 4 different methods to do matching. the key is to find a matching technique that allows for dropped returns and parameter variation. - he talks a lot about the multipath model (ray tracing), but where do you get the environmental model? seems like a big problem. - everything is done in simulation and the conditions of the simulation are never very clear. - wide-band/narrow-band filtering is explaned (good stuff for keeping the SNR despite the noise levels). - all and all, it seems to be pretty weak although i wouldn't tell anybody that.},

  abstract = {This work describes a framework for sensor fusion of navigation data with camera-based 5 DOF relative pose measurements for 6 DOF vehicle motion in an unstructured 3D underwater environment. The fundamental goal of this work is to concurrently estimate online current vehicle position and its past trajectory. This goal is framed within the context of improving mobile robot navigation to support sub-sea science and exploration. Vehicle trajectory is represented by a history of poses in an augmented state Kalman filter. Camera spatial constraints from overlapping imagery provide partial observation of these poses and are used to enforce consistency and provide a mechanism for loop-closure. The multi-sensor camera + navigation framework is shown to have compelling advantages over a camera-only based approach by: 1) improving the robustness of pairwise image registration, 2) setting the free gauge scale, and 3) allowing for a unconnected camera graph topology. Results are shown for a real world data set collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle in an unstructured undersea environment.},

For example, a coordinated group of vehicles with environmental sensors can perform adaptive ocean sampling at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. We describe a methodology for cooperative control of multiple vehicles based on virtual bodies and artificial potentials (VBAP). This methodology allows for adaptable formation control and can be used for missions such as gradient climbing and feature tracking in an uncertain environment. We discuss our implementation on a fleet of autonomous underwater gliders and present results from sea trials in Monterey Bay in August, 2003. These at-sea demonstrations were performed as part of the Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN) II project},

  abstract = {Abstract Observations of wind stress and wind profiles over the ocean reported in the literature over the past 10 years are consistent with Charnock's (1955) relation between aerodynamic roughness length (z0) and friction velocity (u*), viz, z0= αu*2/g, with α= 0.0144 and g= 9.81 m s−2. They also imply a von Kármán constant = 0.41±0.025. For practical purposes Charnock's relation may he closely approximated in the range 4\&<V<21 m s−1 by a neutral drag coefficient (referred to 10 m) varying with the 10 m wind speed V (m s−1), either by a power law relation CDN(10)×103 = 0.51V0.46or a linear form CDN(10)×103= 0.75+0.067V. Results of recent turbulence sensor comparison experiments suggest that much of the source of data scatter in CDN(V) plots and of the systematic differences between data sets is due to calibration uncertainties associated with sensor performance in the field. The effects (if any) of fetch, wind duration and unsteadiness remain obscured in this experimental data scatter. Vertical transfer of momentum over land may be described in terms of an effective roughness length or geostrophic drag coefficient which incorporates the effects of both friction and form drag introduced by flow perturbation around uneven topographical features. Typically low relief topography and low mountains (peaks <0.5–1 km) require a geostrophic drag coefficient CDN≈ 3×10−3, while land surfaces in general require CDN≈ 2×10−3 for which CDN(10)≈ 10×10−3 and the effective aerodynamic roughness length ẑ0(eff)≈ 0.2 m. The latter values satisfy, very approximately, the requirement of global angular momentum balance.},

  Abstract                 = {For the past two years undergraduate engineering students from Olin College of Engineering have worked to develop unmanned surface vehicles as low cost educational platforms for scientific research. As an undergraduate project, the work on the USV involved the student team in a hands-on experience that included in-house design, fabrication, and field operations. Working dominantly out of the Olin Field Robotics Laboratory the first fully operational vehicle completed an unmanned field test in the spring of 2008. Previously in 2007, two students from this project team presented the academic benefits of this self-directed work for engineering and science education at the MTS/IEEE Ocean's Conference in Vancouver. Here we present the data collected from the first autonomous trials carried out by the vehicle as well as the continued work since the Oceans 2007 publication. This work includes the completion of the mechanical design, creation and verification of a mathematical model of the vehicle, and implementation of autonomous control. Lastly, this paper continues to testify to the core benefits of an unmanned vehicle as an undergraduate engineering project, leading not only a to viable vehicle platform but also an extremely valuable learning experience for the team involved.},

  Abstract                 = {This authentic multidisciplinary engineering project worked to develop an Autonomous Surface Craft (ASC) as a platform for scientific field research. The project served as a hands-on educational experience involving in-house design and fabrication and in-the-field operation. This sort of immersive engineering experience exemplifies Olin College's approach to engineering education. This project, focused around marine technology, is particularly effective for interdisciplinary undergraduate education. In addition, the engineering project stands within the larger context of marine studies and oceanography, making it more than just a pure engineering exercise. The goal of the project was to design, build, and field operate a surface vehicle capable of completing autonomous surveys, operated by small scientific teams without the use of specialized equipment. A student team designed the vehicle to carry a wide range of payloads both in terms of weight and power requirements. The team also strove to maximize the educational experience for the design team whenever practical. This goal led to custom construction, specific characterization laboratory experiments, and in-house software components. We present the final prototype, analytical laboratory results, and field data from multiple trials. These results illustrate how the design meets, and in some cases exceeds, the aforementioned design requirements. While this project is still very much a work in progress, the past year's work has already shown a positive impact on the undergraduate students involved. This sort of authentic engineering project focused in marine technology is ideal for undergraduate engineering students looking to learn by doing and gain valuable experience.},

  abstract = {The relationships between the volume of a 4-satellite tetrahedron and the dilutions of precision (GDOP, PDOP, HDOP, VDOP, TDOP) have been frequently quoted and used in technical papers and discussions. The most commonly encountered statement concerning any dilution of precision (DOP) notes that it is approximately inversely proportional to this tetrahedral volume. A closer look at these algebraic, fractional expressions for DOPs shows that this statement is not correct due to the fact that even though volume does appear in the denominator of each DOP, the numerator is not a constant. Thus, some of the factors in the denominator can be cancelled with those same factors that appear in the numerator. The purpose of this paper is to use a sequence of simple arguments to arrive at an exact but complex, set of results which indicate the true relationship(s) between the various DOPs and the tetrahedral volume. Examples for special and limiting cases are also included for clearer illustration as well as to clarify misconceptions},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a modification in the simulation formula for generating stationary stochastic processes, using the spectral representation method developed by Shinozuka, is presented. It is shown that with this modification, the ensemble and temporal autocorrelation function of the simulated stochastic process for fixed values of time lag τ converge to their target autocorrelation function much more quickly. If the sample function is synthesized with N frequencies, then the rate of the convergence is of the order 1/N4 instead of 1/N for the original simulation formula. However, for the whole simulation time T0, the convergences of the autocorrelation functions are not uniform for the time lag τ throughout the range from 0 to T0/2. It turns out that the proposed modified simulation formula is preferable for the time lag |τ| ⩽ T0/2π and the original simulation formula is preferable for the time lag T0/2π < |τ| ⩽ T0/2.},

We have used experimental data to build an underwater map and to investigate the estimation performance. Since the problem is non-linear, due to the measurement relation, we apply a sequential Monte Carlo method, or particle filter, for the state estimation. The fundamental limitations in navigation uncertainty can be described in terms of the Cramer-Rao lower bound, which is interpreted in terms of the inertial navigation system (INS) error, the sensor accuracy and the terrain map excitation. Hence, the Cramer-Rao lower bound can be interpreted and used in the design for INS systems, sensor performance or, if these are given, how much terrain or depth excitation that is needed for use in positioning and navigation.},

Simple rule of thumbs for how performance depends on the map and sensor quality are derived. Second, a more realistic five state model is proposed, and Rao-Blackwellization is applied to decrease computational complexity. Monte-Carlo simulations on the map demonstrate a performance comparable to the CRLB.},

Models of the significant hydrodynamic effects including radiation-induced and damping forces and moments are incorporated. Disturbance models of forces and moments caused by ocean currents, waves, and wind are also included. Detailed models of the actuators including thrusters/propellers and control surfaces are included. To illustrate the importance of a six DOF modeling and the impact of disturbances, simulation results with two different controllers are presented. The detailed mathematical modeling in this paper is intended to provide the appropriate framework for a control design which explicitly addresses the six DOF USSV dynamics along with the disturbances.},

Basically the procedure reduced the problem of assessing accuracy to that of calculating the moments and products of inertia of a simple mass constellation. This paper derives analogous results for range-range and range-sum multilateration tion systems. It also extends the results to take account of an independent position fix (e. g., barometric altitude). The new results have numerous uses. For example, the results make crystal clear the relative accuracies of the hyperbolic, range-range, and range-sum techniques. The results also make it easy to understand the salient accuracy characteristics of practical satellite-based and ground-based multilateration systems. Finally, the results provide a basis for deriving new bounds on the performance of range-range and range-sum systems.},

Because of complex wave structure interactions, most path following control designs neglect the wave impact at the design stage and rely on simulation or experiment to ensure the
satisfactory performance in wave fields. In this paper, we first introduce a numerical test bed that combines the ship dynamics and wave effects on vessels to facilitate the model-base performance evaluation of path following control systems in wave fields. Then, a novel robust path following
controller is described and its key features are summarized. Simulation results of the path following controller in the wave field are presented. Several issues, such as steady-state errors and rudder oscillations, have been identified, thereby motivating controller modification and gain retuning.
Mitigating strategies for improving the controller performance are proposed and numerically evaluated. The simulation results show that the performance of the modified controller can be substantially improved in wave fields.},

  Abstract                 = {At the MIT Sea Grant College Program, autonomous surface craft (ASCs) have been under development since 1993. These systems have been designed for various missions and have demonstrated success in three separate iterations. The current goal of ASC research at MIT is to develop an easily deployed system that can serve as a tool for educational use, as a precision survey platform, and as a communications and navigation link to an AUV. In the past, this goal has been hampered by limitations in the mechanical design of the current system. Since September 1998 significant improvements have been made to the design of the current ASC. New power, propulsion, and control systems have been installed. These improve the performance of the vehicle and significantly reduce the mechanical and electronic failures that troubled the previous system. In addition, structural modifications have been made to make deployments and operations easier. These design improvements promise to make the ASC a more useful tool for, and provide greater service to, the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Laboratory at MIT. The paper briefly presents the history of ASC development at MIT. It then documents the design changes made to the current vehicle. The problems experienced with the old designs are identified and the improvements represented by the new systems are explained. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the next mission for the ASC},

  abstract = {Abstract Analysis of the directional spectra of typical sets of surface wave data obtained in the open sea as well asa bay using a cloverleaf buoy system are reported. It is shown that the directional wave spectrum can be approximated by the product of the frequencyspectrum and a unimodal angular distribution with mean direction approximately equal to that of thewind, and that various forms of frequency spectra exist, even in relatively simple wave systems, dependingon their generating conditions. Ocean waves at fairly short dimensionless fetches show spectral forms withvery narrow spectral width, which are similar to those of laboratory wind waves. On the other hand, thespectral forms for ocean waves at very long dimensionless fetches are quite similar to the Pierson-Moskowitzspectra, which are considered, within our present data, to be the wave spectra with the largest spectral width.Finally, there exist many ocean waves at moderate dimensionless fetches, which show spectral forms with interminate spectral widths lying between the above two extremes. However, a definite relationship betweenthe spectral width and the dimensionless fetch has not been obtained in the present study. Concerning the angular distribution, it is shown that the shape of the angular distribution is dependenton the frequency of the spectral component even in a simple wave system in a generating area, althoughthe mean directions ot the spectral components are independent of the frequency and approximately equalto the wind direction. The angular distribution is very narrow for frequencies near the dominant peak of thefrequency spectrum, whereas it widens rapidly toward high and low frequencies. Thus, the major energy-containing frequency components propagate in almost the same direction as the wind with the least angularspreading. Finally, it is shown that a similarity law is satisfied for the angular distributions, and an idealized formof the angular distribution function is derived for practical purposes.},

Here, two wind gust spectra based on maritime data are used to serve the purpose of demonstrating the effect of wave age; the spectra according to Wills et al. (1986 “Offshore Mean Wind Profile,” Department of Energy, Offshore Technical Report No. OTH86226) and Ochi and Shin (1988, “Wind Turbulent Spectra for Design Considerations of Offshore Structures,” Proceedings of the 20th Offshore Technology Conference, Houston, TX, Paper No. 5736, pp. 461–467). The effect of wave age is taken into account by using the Volkov (2001, “The Dependence on Wave Age,” in Wind Stress Over the Ocean, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, pp. 206–217) sea surface roughness formula. The wave age independent Charnock (1955, “Wind Stress on a Water Surface,” Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 81, pp. 639–640) sea surface roughness is used as a reference. The results are valid for wind waves in local equilibrium with steady wind in laterally homogeneous flow. An example of results demonstrates a clear effect of wave age on the wind gust spectra; also, distinct differences between the two spectra for a given wave age are demonstrated. Finally, an example of application is provided, demonstrating clear effects of the two spectra and the sea surface roughness on slowly varying surge motion of a marine structure due to wind gust.}},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a system capable of simultaneously estimating the position of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and the positions of stationary range-only beacons. Notably, our system does not require beacon positions a priori, and our system performs well even when range measurements are severely degraded by noise and outliers. We present a powerful outlier rejection method that can identify groups of range measurements that are consistent with each other, and a method for initializing beacon positions in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). We have successfully applied our algorithms to real-world data and have demonstrated a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system whose navigation performance is comparable to that of systems that assume known beacon locations},

  abstract = {Robotic underwater vehicles are regularly performing vast optical surveys of the ocean floor. Scientists value these surveys since optical images offer high levels of detail and are easily interpreted by humans. Unfortunately, the coverage of a single image is limited by absorption and backscatter while what is generally desired is an overall view of the survey area. Recent works on underwater mosaics assume planar scenes and are applicable only to situations without much relief. We present a complete and validated system for processing optical images acquired from an underwater robotic vehicle to form a 3D reconstruction of the ocean floor. Our approach is designed for the most general conditions of wide-baseline imagery (low overlap and presence of significant 3D structure) and scales to hundreds or thousands of images. We only assume a calibrated camera system and a vehicle with uncertain and possibly drifting pose information (e.g., a compass, depth sensor, and a Doppler velocity log). Our approach is based on a combination of techniques from computer vision, photogrammetry, and robotics. We use a local to global approach to structure from motion, aided by the navigation sensors on the vehicle to generate 3D sub-maps. These sub-maps are then placed in a common reference frame that is refined by matching overlapping sub-maps. The final stage of processing is a bundle adjustment that provides the 3D structure, camera poses, and uncertainty estimates in a consistent reference frame. We present results with ground truth for structure as well as results from an oceanographic survey over a coral reef.},

  Abstract                 = {Describes the development and verification of a six degree of freedom, non-linear simulation model for the REMUS AUV, the first such model for this platform. In this model, the external forces and moments resulting from hydrostatics, hydrodynamic lift and drag, added mass, and the control inputs of the vehicle propeller and fins are all defined in terms of vehicle coefficients. The paper briefly describes the derivation of these coefficients. The equations determining the coefficients, as well as those describing the vehicle rigid-body dynamics, are left in non-linear form to better simulate the inherently non-linear behavior of the vehicle. Simulation of the vehicle motion is achieved through numeric integration of the equations of motion. The simulator output is then verified against vehicle dynamics data collected in experiments performed at sea. The simulator is shown to accurately model the motion of the vehicle. The paper concludes with recommendations for future model validation experiments},

  abstract = {Ad hoc localization of wireless sensor nodes is a fundamental problem in wireless sensor networks. Despite the recent proposals for the development of ad hoc localization algorithms, the fundamental behavior in systems using measurements has not been characterized. In this paper, we take a first step toward such a characterization by examining the behavior of error inducing parameters in multihop localization systems in an algorithm independent manner. We first derive the Crame Rao Bound for Gaussian measurement error for multihop localization systems using distance and angular measurements. Later on, we use these bounds on a carefully controlled set of scenarios to study the trends in the error induced by the measurement technology accuracy, network density, beacon node concentration, and beacon uncertainty. By exposing these trends, the goal of this paper is to develop a fundamental understanding of the error behavior that can provide a set of guidelines to be considered during the design and deployment of multihop localization systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent advent of high speed digital computers has made it not only possible but also highly practical to apply the Monte Carlo techniques to a large variety of engineering problems. In this paper a technique of digital simulation of multivariate and/or multidimensional Gaussian random processes (homogeneous or nonhomogeneous) which can represent physical processes germane to structural engineering is presented. The paper also describes a method of digital simulation of envelope functions. Such simulations are accomplished in terms of a sum of cosine functions with random phase angles and used as the basic tool in a general Monte Carlo method of solution of a wide class of problems in structural engineering. Most important problems for which the method is found extremely useful includes (a) numerical analysis of dynamic response of nonlinear structures to random excitations, (b) time domain analysis of linear structures under random excitations performed for the purpose of obtaining a kind of information, such as first excursion probability and time history of a sample function, that is not obtainable from the standard frequency domain analysis, (c) numerical solution of structural problems involving randomly nonhomogeneous material property such as wave propagation through random medium, and (d) dynamic analysis of extremely complex systems such as those involving structure-fluid interaction. Numerical examples of some of these problems are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {{The subject of this paper is the simulation of one-dimensional, uni-variate, stationary, Gaussian stochastic processes using the spectral representation method. Following this methodology, sample functions of the stochastic process can be generated with great computational efficiency using a cosine series formula. These sample functions accurately reflect the prescribed probabilistic characteristics of the stochastic process when the number N of the terms in the cosine series is large. The ensemble-averaged power spectral density or autocorrelation function approaches the corresponding target function as the sample size increases. In addition, the generated sample functions possess ergodic characteristics in the sense that the temporally-averaged mean value and the autocorrelation function are identical with the corresponding targets, when the averaging takes place over the fundamental period of the cosine series. The most important property of the simulated stochastic process is that it is asymptotically Gaussian as N → ∞. Another attractive feature of the method is that the cosine series formula can be numerically computed efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform technique. The main area of application of this method is the Monte Carlo solution of stochastic problems in engineering mechanics and structural engineering. Specifically, the method has been applied to problems involving random loading (random vibration theory) and random material and geometric properties (response variability due to system stochasticity).}},

  Abstract                 = {The Ocean Engineering Department at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and the Naval Postgraduate have implemented AUV acoustic positioning systems based on the Desert Star Dive Tracker short base line (SBL) system. The motivation for these implementation efforts was to develop a short range, inexpensive, but relatively high precision navigation system for each institution's autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In the NPS case the SBL system is to support navigation of their Phoenix vehicle in mine reconnaissance type missions where the vehicle needs to more precisely locate obstacles and mine like objects. In the FAU case the SBL system is to support guidance of the Ocean Explorer (OEX) vehicle in rendezvous and docking maneuvers. The Dive Tracker SBL can produce supposed positioning accuracies on the order of 6" rms. FAU has build a portable easily deployed collapsible frame for supporting 3 SBL transducers or beacons. The frame is arranged in star that is anchored to the bottom. The baseline between transducers is approximately 20 ft. The OEX carries a transducer and electronics that compute its position relative to the baseline. A docking target placed near the baseline and anchored to the bottom. The location of the target is then determined by manually positioning the AUV transducer at the target and taking SBL fixes, A series of at-sea tests of this system have been conducted. This paper presents results of the at sea tests of this positioning system off the coast of Boca Raton Florida. The analysis will comment on the efficacy of this type of system for guidance of small AUVs in docking maneuvers},

  Abstract                 = {We explore the capabilities of a robot designed to locate objects underwater through active movement of an electric field emitter and sensor apparatus. The robot is inspired by the biological phenomenon of active electrolocation, a sensing strategy found in two groups of freshwater fishes known to emit weak electric fields for target localization and communication. We characterize the performance of the robot using several types of automatic electrolocation controllers, objects, and water conditions. We demonstrate successful electrolocation both in the conditions in which it is naturally observed, in low conductivity water, as well as in conditions in which it is not observed, in water of ocean salinity. The belief of the position of the target is maintained via a particle filter and refined with each measurement},

However, it seems likely that the ship is a merchantman of around 40 meters in length that was either trading on the Norwegian coast or passing by. Using the unique new technology developed for this project it is possible to conduct mapping, surveying, sampling and excavation of shipwrecks in deep water. The Ormen Lange project is the most technologically advanced deepwater archaeology project, and first major deepwater archaeological excavation of a shipwreck that has been performed world-wide. The only comparable projects are treasure related salvage operations, but these cannot be called marine archaeology. In fact, this project shows that marine archaeology in deepwater can be carried out with purely scientific goals and without economic motives. 14 shipwrecks have been discovered in the pipeline routes. This clearly shows that the potential of deepwater archaeology is high. Marine archaeological investigations should therefore be an integral part of all industrial development projects in deepwater.},

Our work is motivated by applications for which communications bandwidth is severely limited, such for platoons of autonomous underwater vehicles. The communication requirements for our trajectory generation approach are independent of the number of vehicles in the platoon, enabling platoons composed of a large number of vehicles to be coordinated despite limited communication bandwidth.},

  abstract = {Abstract Distribution of the wind stress over the oceans is usually estimated by using a bulk formula. It contains the squared 10-m wind speed multiplied by the drag coefficient, which has been assumed in many cases to be a weak function of the 10-m wind speed. Over land the important role of thermal stratification has been clearly recognized, but over the sea the influence of wind waves is less well documented. This paper presents evidence showing the likelihood that the influence of the wind waves can also be large. Charnock proposed an expression for the marine atmospheric boundary layer roughness parameter, z0, which depended only on the wind friction velocity, u☆ and the acceleration of gravity, g. Toba and Koga have recently proposed an alternative expression for flow over growing wind waves, which are in local equilibrium with the wind, given by a form including the wind-wave spectral peak frequency explicity. The criterion for local equilibrium of the wave field with the wind is its consistency with the 3/2power law between nondimensional wave height and wave period normalized by u☆ and g. The differences between these expressions are significant. The two expressions are compared with a composite dataset which comprises some representative data from laboratories and tower stations together with data from storms at an oil producing platform in Bass Strait, Australia. In these storms strong winds up to 25 m s−1 and large wind waves up to 12 s in significant wave period, from a direction of long fetch, lasted for two or three days. The composite dataset shows that the drag coefficient CD depends also on the sea scale and that in storm conditions CD can be larger by a factor of two to three than the value that Charnock's expression usually predicts. Further experiments focussing on the examination of the effect of ocean waves on the wind stress are recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes an acoustic super short baseline (SSBL) tracking system capable of tracking up to twenty targets simultaneously, accurately and at long ranges. The design of the hydrophone array is similar to that of conventional SSBL arrays, but uses greater inter-element separation to provide much better tracking accuracy. With this design, the bearing and elevation of targets at ranges greater than 10 km can be tracked with an accuracy better than 0.1 degree. Some applications of SSBL include: full ocean depth SSBL systems for ROV navigation and tracking; towbody tracking; integrated long baseline (LBL) and SSBL navigation; and long seismic streamer tracking. This paper discusses the design and performance of an integrated SSBL/LBL system that provides 0.1% slant range accuracy at ranges greater than those achievable using currently available SSBL tracking systems},

There seem to be many analogies to this paradigm of motor learning to what i'm currently thinking about in terms of learning for an AUV. It is important to consider that what hypothesis gridding is about is about learning about the environment. Forward (predictive) models and Reverse () models. A model maps the sensor and actuator signals. Feedforward control is essential form natural movement (you must have a forward model!). "Learning involves changes in behavioir that arise from interaction with the environment and is distinct from maturations." Makes some statements about learning being necessary for robustness. Learning on various time scales - individuals life and over generations. This parallels the idea of learning over a mission, through multiple missions, and across multiple platforms. Types of learning: supervised, reinforcement, and unsupervised. Reinforcement learning is difficult (where there is no explicit objective funcion, only a good/bad binary feedback) because the inputs-outputs if the inverse model are one-to-many. Also requires "temporal-credit-assignment" to decide which past actions contributed to the outcome (sensitivities). Representation: Look-up tables, Basis functions, and Parametric functions.},

The stationary envelope processes are simulated by using the fast Fourier transform while the nonstationary envelope processes are simulated as the square root of the sum of a series of cosine functions and a series of sine functions with random phase angles. Typical applications of the envelope simulation are the simulations of peaks and troughs which play an important role in the analyses of the first excursion probability, fatigue and crack propagation. In particular, applications to the crack propagation under random loadings are demonstrated in detail.},

  abstract  = {A ship’s real-time three-dimensional (3D) visualization system, a component of a handling simulator, is one of its most important components, since realistic and intuitive image generation play an essential role in improving the effects of education using ship navigation simulators. Ship handling simulators should have capabilities of calculating ship motions (heave, pitch, and roll) at any given sea state and display the calculated motions through a real-time 3D visualization system. The motion solver of a ship handling simulator calculates those motions in addition to maneuverings for an own ship, the main simulation target, but only provides maneuvering information about traffic ships. Therefore, it is required to simulate traffic ship and buoy motions arising from ocean waves in a ship handling simulator for realistic visualization. In this paper, the authors propose a simple dynamics model by which ship and buoy motions are calculated with the input data of wave height and discuss a method for the implementation of a ship and buoy motion calculation module. The feasibility of the proposed dynamics model and the motion calculation module has been demonstrated through the development of a prototype real-time 3D visualization system based on an open-source 3D graphics engine.},

  abstract = {The problem of designing, implementing and testing a general-purpose guidance and control system for unmanned underwater vehicles for scientific applications is addressed in this paper. A three-level hierarchical architecture is proposed in order to uncouple the execution of user-defined motion-task functions with respect to the operating environment (guidance), from linear and angular speed control and mapping of the required control actions onto the actuation system. The introduction of PI-type task functions enables a conventional Lyapunov-based guidance system to counteract the effects both of unmodelled, i.e. unmeasured kinematic interactions between the vehicle and the environment, and of bias in velocity measurements. The vehicle dynamics are managed by conventional gain scheduling regulators performing velocity control, while an advanced actuator model, which considers propeller–hull interactions, improves the precision of the thrust to propeller rate mapping. Preliminary tests, carried out in a high-diving pool with an over-actuated prototype ROV, proved the system's functionality and showed high performances in terms of its precision in accomplishing near bottom slow motion tasks, e.g. altitude and hovering control and trajectory tracking, even when the mapping of the required control actions onto the actuation system is reconfigured to face any type of thruster fault. },

  abstract = {A nonlinear black-box structure for a dynamical system is a model structure that is prepared to describe virtually any nonlinear dynamics. There has been considerable recent interest in this area, with structures based on neural networks, radial basis networks, wavelet networks and hinging hyperplanes, as well as wavelet-transform-based methods and models based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules. This paper describes all these approaches in a common framework, from a user's perspective. It focuses on what are the common features in the different approaches, the choices that have to be made and what considerations are relevant for a successful system-identification application of these techniques. It is pointed out that the nonlinear structures can be seen as a concatenation of a mapping form observed data to a regression vector and a nonlinear mapping from the regressor space to the output space. These mappings are discussed separately. The latter mapping is usually formed as a basis function expansion. The basis functions are typically formed from one simple scalar function, which is modified in terms of scale and location. The expansion from the scalar argument to the regressor space is achieved by a radial- or a ridge-type approach. Basic techniques for estimating the parameters in the structures are criterion minimization, as well as two-step procedures, where first the relevant basis functions are determined, using data, and then a linear least-squares step to determine the coordinates of the function approximation. A particular problem is to deal with the large number of potentially necessary parameters. This is handled by making the number of ‘used’ parameters considerably less than the number of ‘offered’ parameters, by regularization, shrinking, pruning or regressor selection.},

The U.S. Minerals Management Service has recommended that the OCD model be used for emissions located on the outer continental shelf. During southerly winds over the Gulf of Mexico, for example, the pollutants from hundreds of offshore platforms may affect the gulf coasts. In the OCD model, the overwater plume is described by the Gaussian equation, which requires the computation of σy and σz, which are, in turn, related to the turbulence intensity, overwater trajectory, and atmospheric stability. On the basis of several air–sea interaction experiments [the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX), the Air-Mass Transformation Experiment (AMTEX), and, most recently, the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE)] and the extensive datasets from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), it is shown that under neutral and stable conditions the overwater turbulence intensities are linearly proportional to the gust factor (G), which is the ratio of the wind gust and mean wind speed at height z (Uz) as reported hourly by the NDBC buoys. Under unstable conditions, it is first shown that the popular formula relating the horizontal turbulence intensity (σu,υ/u∗, where u∗ is the friction velocity) to the ratio of the mixing height (h) and the buoyancy length (L) (i.e., h/L) suffers from a self-correlation problem and cannot be used in the marine environment. Then, alternative formulas to estimate the horizontal turbulence intensities (σu,υ/Uz) using G are proposed for practical applications. Furthermore, formulas to estimate u∗ and z/L are fundamentally needed in air–sea interaction studies, in addition to dispersion meteorology.}},

  abstract = {An efficient algorithm to simulate turbulent, atmospheric or wind tunnel generated wind fields is devised. The method is based on a model of the spectral tensor for atmospheric surface-layer turbulence at high wind speeds and can simulate two- or three-dimensional fields of one, two or three components of the wind velocity fluctuations. The spectral tensor is compared with and adjusted to several spectral models commonly used in wind engineering. Compared to the Sandia method (see Veers, P. S., Three-dimensional wind simulation. Technical Report SAND88-0152, Sandia National Laboratories, 1988) the algorithm is more efficient, simpler to implement, and in some respects more physical. The simulation method is currently used for load calculations on wind turbines and bridges.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the characteristics of over-water gust factors and turbulence at three offshore locations, and evaluates several techniques for predicting over-water gusts. Mean gust factors were found to agree well with previously published values: typical average values for G(1,3600) and G(3,3600) at 13.4 m elevation were 1.34 and 1.30, respectively. Gust factors were found to be most sensitive to gust duration (t), elevation (z) and measuring interval (T). Wave height, wind speed, and atmospheric stability were observed to have only slight influences on gust factors. Mean values for σ/u∗ ranged from 2.26 to 2.58 in general agreement with published values. σ/u∗ was observed to display less sensitivity to wind speed and elevation than σ/U, suggesting it was a more stable parameter to use in modelling gust factors. The inclusion of stability effects in the calculation of u∗ was found to decrease the height dependence of σ/u∗ which was important for reliable gust factor prediction at higher elevations. The gust factor model evaluation revealed that a number of available models can provide good predictions of average gust factors. However, no model was able to account for the observed variation in individual over-water gust factors. Incorporation of the Geernaert et al. [(1987), Measurements of wind stress, heat flux and turbulence intensity turbulence storm conditions over the North Sea. J. geophys. Res. 92, 13127–13139] drag coeffecient/wave age relationship into an existing gust model did little to improve results. Several models were able to provide reasonable estimates of the peak gust occuring over a number of wind samples by adding a 95% confidence limit to the predicted maximum gust, or by increasing T to reflect the combined duration of all wind samples. A modified version of the Forristall [(1987) , Wind spectra and gust factors over water, Proceedings of the 20th Annual Offshore Technology Conference, Houston, Texas, 2–5 May 1988, OTC 5735, pp. 449–460] approach was recommended for use offshore where the vertical gust factor profile was important. Further work and better data are required to develop a modelling technique which can replicate the observed variability in over-water gusts.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Until recently, the natural environment has played a very minor role in ship design. The consideration of ship performance in the prevailing environment was focused primarily on optimization of calm water resistance and other factors related to the ship's propulsion system. During the 197os, the NAVY recognized the need to “design in” better ship performance and initiated the R\&D efforts necessary to establish a technology base for doing so. This paper outlines the state-of-the-art for environmental (primarily wave) modelling in the emerging seakeeping performance oriented design procedures. The sensitivity of the ship system to the environment is briefly examined. A standard procedure for specifying wave and wind conditions for ship design is recommended. Revision of U.S. Navy applied Sea State numeral definitions is discussed. A standard for specifying Sea State occurrences is offered as a new design tool.},
